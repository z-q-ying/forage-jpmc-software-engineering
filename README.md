# JP Morgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program

## Overview
This repository contains the tasks and accomplishments from the JP Morgan Chase's Software Engineering virtual experience program. The focus is on building and enhancing a financial data feed for a trader's dashboard to help them identify under/over-valued stocks.

**Technologies:**
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Perspective (by JPMorgan Chase)
- HTML & CSS
- Python
- React

## Demonstration
After starting the web server on your local machine, click on **Start Streaming Data**. The data feed will then be refreshed and loaded continuously at 0.1-second intervals.
